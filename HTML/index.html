    <h1>Heading Tag used for this line. </h1> <!--h1 here is considered as HTML Tag-->
    <h2> H2, Second heading tag used for this</h2>
    <h6> H carried with 1-6 can be used for heading tags, now, the thing is, this number defines the importance of the heading. The smaller the number, the more important the heading. i.e heading, sub heading, sub sub heading, so the font sizes changes per heading tag. Different heading tags should not be used simply for font size instead it should be used as headings to a para.</h6>
    <h3>It is important to use heading tags correctly. because google's search algorithm uses headings. Use CSS for font sizing.</h3>

    <a href = "https://www.google.com/"> This is an anchor tag, used for hypertexting websites  </a>
    <!-- <a href = "URL"> Link text</a>     
     Here "a" is the anchor tag
     (hyper text reference)"href" is the attribute to the anchor tag.  
     the link text is the text that will show in place of the url , as Hypertexted URL.-->
